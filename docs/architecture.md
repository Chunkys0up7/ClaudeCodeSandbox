# Home Lending Practitioner AI App Store Architecture

## System Overview

The Home Lending Practitioner AI App Store is designed as a modular, scalable platform that enables the creation, management, and execution of AI-driven applications for home lending processes.

## Core Components

### 1. Application Registry (Python)

The Application Registry is responsible for:
- Storing metadata about available applications
- Managing application versions and dependencies
- Providing a discovery mechanism for users

### 2. App Store Backend (Java)

The Java-based backend provides:
- User authentication and authorization
- Application lifecycle management
- Data processing and transformation services

### 3. MCP Integration Layer

The MCP (Model Control Platform) integration layer:
- Manages AI model deployments
- Monitors model performance and drift
- Provides compliance and governance controls

## Data Flow

1. Users interact with the AI App Store interface
2. Requests are processed by the Java backend services
3. Application data is retrieved from the Python-based registry
4. AI models are deployed and managed through the MCP layer
5. Results are returned to users with appropriate governance controls

## Security Model

- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Audit logging for all critical operations
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Compliance with regulatory requirements

## Deployment Architecture

The platform is designed to be deployed in a containerized environment with:
- Microservices architecture for scalability
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment
- Monitoring and alerting systems
